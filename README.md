# üöÅ Drone Swarm Assignment

## Introduction

The Drone Swarm Assignment focuses on simulating the fundamental principles of swarm robotics using Python and Pygame.  
Swarm robotics is inspired by the collective behavior of natural systems such as flocks of birds, schools of fish, or colonies of ants, where simple individual agents coordinate to achieve complex group objectives.  

This project introduces the foundational elements required to build such a system.  
- **Task 1** explores player-controlled movement in a bounded 2D environment, representing the basic control of a single drone.  
- **Task 2** extends the simulation by introducing an enemy object, enabling collision detection and interaction between agents in the environment.  

The ultimate objective of the project is to lay the groundwork for simulating a coordinated drone swarm. Such systems can be applied in various real-world domains, including:  
- Search and rescue operations  
- Environmental monitoring  
- Military surveillance  
- Autonomous delivery networks  

By breaking the problem into incremental tasks, this assignment demonstrates how simple behaviors can evolve into more complex swarm intelligence systems, highlighting the importance of modular design and interaction modeling in robotics research.
